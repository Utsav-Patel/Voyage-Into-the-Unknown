# Voyage-Into-the-Unknown
This is repository for the first project of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Rutgers University.

[The details of the project are given here ](https://github.com/Utsav-Patel/Voyage-Into-the-Unknown/blob/main/Assignment_1.pdf)


### Goal -

The main goal of our project is to create 100x100 grids where each cell has some random chance to be blocked. We then place an AI agent at position (0,0) and have to make
the agent reach position (100,100). The agent does not know which cells in the grid are blocked or unblocked. But the agent can 'see' the status (blocked or unblocked) of
its four cardinal neighbors. A sample grid with the agents path will look like this -
